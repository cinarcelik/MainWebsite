<h2>My Personal Website <em>www.cinarcelik.cc</em></h2>

This is the project repository for my main website's front-end development codes.<br>I learned and used various languages, libraries and extensions for this project, such as:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Languages</th>
    <th>Libraries</th>
    <th>Extensions</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>HTML5</th>
    <th>jQuery</th>
    <th>Popper</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>CSS3</th>
    <th>Bootstrap4</th>
    <th>Icons8</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>JavaScript</th>
    <th></th>
    <th>Fromspree</th>
  </tr>
</table>
As this is my first website ever, I am experimenting with new things and I frequently update it with new codes and content.
