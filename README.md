# My Personal Website *www.cinarcelik.cc*

This is the project repository for my main website's front-end development codes.
I learned and used various languages, libraries and extensions for this project, such as:

| Languages  | Libraries | Extensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTML5  | jQuery  | Popper  |
| CSS3  | Bootstrap4  | Icons8  |
| JavaScript  | | Formspree  |
| | | Sass  |

As this is **my first website ever**, I am experimenting with new things and I frequently update it with new codes and content.
I would be very glad if you could visit my website. Also, you can leave me a comment using the contact form located at the bottom of the website if you like.
**Thank you!**
