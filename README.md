<h1>My Personal Website</h1>
<h2>cinarcelik.cc</h2>

This is the project repository for my main website's front-end development codes.
I learned and used <strong>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</strong> languages and <strong>Bootstrap 4</strong> framework for this project. I also used a couple of open source extensions such as <strong>Popper</strong> and <strong>Icons8</strong>. As this is my first website ever, I am experimenting with new things and I frequently update it with new codes and contents.

The website is built to be a multi-page project so that I can use the pages for specific tasks.
