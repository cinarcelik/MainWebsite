<h1>My Main Website</h1>
<h2>cinarcelik.cc</h2>

This is the project repository for my main website's front-end development codes.
I learned and used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 and a couple opensource extensions such as Popper, MixItUp and Icons8 for this project.
The website is built to be a multi-page project that I can use the pages for specific tasks.

I want to design and develop another one-page personal website in the future.
