<h2>My Personal Website <em>www.cinarcelik.cc</em></h2>

<p>This is the project repository for my main website's front-end development codes.<br>I learned and used various languages, libraries and extensions for this project, such as:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Languages</th>
    <th>Libraries</th>
    <th>Extensions</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>HTML5</th>
    <th>jQuery</th>
    <th>Popper</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>CSS3</th>
    <th>Bootstrap4</th>
    <th>Icons8</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>JavaScript</th>
    <th></th>
    <th>Fromspree</th>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As this is <strong>my first website ever</strong>, I am experimenting with new things and I frequently update it with new codes and content.<br>I would be very glad if you could visit my website. Also, you can leave me a comment using the contact form located at the bottom of the website if you like.<br><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
