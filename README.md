# My Main Website
# cinarcelik.cc

This is the project repository for my main website's front-end development codes.
I learned and used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 and a couple opensource extensions such as Popper, MixItuP and Icons8 for this project.
The website is built to be a multi-page project that I can use the pages for specific tasks.

I want to design and develop another one-page personal website in the future.
